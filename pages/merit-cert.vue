    <p>
      We sponsor the music study program, Certificate of MeritÂ® (CM), an evaluation program that was originally created and developed by the Music Teachers' Association of California in 1933. The program provides a standard of curriculum that requires students to strive for focused musical excellence in performance, technique, ear training, sight reading/singing, and music theory. Outstanding young musicians are given the opportunity to appear on State Convention programs.
