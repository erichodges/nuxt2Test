We are a local professional organization of highly qualified and experienced music teachers. We live in your neighborhood and we are dedicated to excellence in our teaching and to fostering a life-long love of music in our students.

      We sponsor the Certificate of Merit® (CM), an evaluation program that was originally created and developed by the Music Teachers' Association of California in 1933. The program provides a standard of curriculum that requires students to strive for focused musical excellence in performance, technique, ear training, sight reading/singing and music theory. Outstanding young musicians are given the opportunity to appear on State Convention programs.

      <h2>Margaret Bean Davis Memorial Piano Competition</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Our performance competition is named in honor of Margaret Bean Davis, a wonderful musician and composer who was also a long-time supporter of music in Marin County.   Each year talented young pianists compete before three distinguished pianists in six levels:  Intermediate A, B, C and D and Advanced A and B.  The winners then perform at an annual Winners' Recital in the late spring.
