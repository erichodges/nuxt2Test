    <h1>Highly qualified and experienced music teachers in Marin</h1>
    <br>
    <p>
      MTAC Marin is one of more than 67 self-governing branches that are affiliated with the Music Teachers' Association of California. We are a local professional organization of highly qualified and experienced music teachers. We live in your neighborhood and we are dedicated to excellence in our teaching and to fostering a life-long love of music in our students. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We offer lessons to students of all ages in piano, organ, harpsichord, violin, viola, cello, flute, clarinet, saxophone, voice, conducting, music theory, composition, harp and accordion.
    </p>
    <p>
      We sponsor the Certificate of MeritÂ® (CM), an evaluation program that was originally created and developed by the Music Teachers' Association of California in 1933. The program provides a standard of curriculum that requires students to strive for focused musical excellence in performance, technique, ear training, sight reading/singing and music theory. Outstanding young musicians are given the opportunity to appear on State Convention programs.
